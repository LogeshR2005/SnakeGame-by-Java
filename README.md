Snake Game in Java
Description
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java. The Snake Game is a popular retro game where the player controls a snake that continuously moves around the screen. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls of the game area and the snake's own body. The snake grows longer each time it consumes food, making the game progressively more challenging.

Features
Snake Movement: The snake moves in a continuous manner and can change direction using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

Food Generation: Food is randomly generated on the game board. The snake needs to consume the food to grow longer.

Score Tracking: The player's score increases with each food item consumed.

Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake's head, body, and the game boundaries, leading to game over scenarios.

Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body. The player's final score is displayed, and they have the option to restart the game.

How to Play
Launch the Game: Run the Java application to start the Snake Game.

Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake's movement.

Eat Food: Guide the snake to consume the food items that appear on the screen. Each food item consumed increases your score and the length of the snake.

Avoid Collisions: Be careful not to collide with the walls of the game area or the snake's own body. Collisions lead to game over.

Game Over: When the snake collides with an obstacle, the game ends. Your final score will be displayed, and you can choose to restart the game.
